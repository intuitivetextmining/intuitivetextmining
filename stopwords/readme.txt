stopword lists
==============

minimal-stop.txt
This short list is from http://text-analytics101.rxnlp.com/2014/10/all-about-stop-words-for-text-mining.html but with some words added by myself.
When reading, ignore lines beginning with '#' as they are comments.


terrier-stop.txt
A larger set of stop words also from http://text-analytics101.rxnlp.com/2014/10/all-about-stop-words-for-text-mining.html.
The terrier platform is opensource - http://terrier.org from Glasgow University.
